Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
    The application that was developed for this course was a weight tracking application that leveraged a NoSQL database for holding user data, sign in and credential savings, and communication preferences (via settings screen). The needs of a user would be to be able to set a weight goal track their weight over time. This enables a user to see their weight loss, gain, or maintenance progression over a given period of time.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
    The screens required for the development of this application are as follows:
      A sign in screen.
      A main screen with weight tracking data.
        The main screen includes historical weights that were recorded as well as the main goal
      A screen for recording a new weight
      A screen for editing a weight in the table
      A screen for user settings (communication preferences)
    The overall functionality of the application enabled us to have a user centric design by enabling easy to use and find buttons that were self explanitory of their function. We also would load new pages for new actions that the user was looking to be completed. This ensures that the user confirmed that the button they clicked was registered, as a new page would load. Overall I believe that the designs were successful, however marketplace and review feedback will be required in order to confirm this.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
    Overall the strategies that I used for development of my application was to break down the functionality of the application into separate packages. This allowed for logical building and maintainability of the code. This can be applied in the future by ensuring that all applicable classes stay organized and structured in a logical fashion.
    
How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
    The functionality of the app was confirmed by simply using the Android emulator and utilizing/testing all functions of the app. This is extremely important, as if the application does not function well, users will simply go to another competitor.
    
Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
    The main place that I had to innovate in the development process of this application was actually in the development process. Initially I was having a hard time with implementation of a NoSQL database to hold the data. The implementation of this was harder than I originally thought, however I leverage stackoverflow and the text book to find how to best implement this in my app. Another issue I had was the actual setup of Android studio which I could not install on my machine, so instad I had to use a virtual machine.
    
In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
    I think that the portion of the app that I was most successful with was the UI side. I felt that the creation of UI elements was really fun and I was able to get creative with the implementation of colors. I did not have any experience with this in the past, however I found it to be the most fun portion of the development process of this application.
